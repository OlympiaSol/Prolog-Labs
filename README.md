These Prolog labs are a collection of exercises designed for the 2023 academic year at the University of Ioannina. Through these labs, students are introduced to the fundamentals of Prolog programming, exploring its unique paradigm of logic programming. The exercises challenge students to apply Prolog's declarative approach to solve problems, encouraging the development of logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Each lab is structured to progressively build upon the students' knowledge, enabling them to master Prolog's syntax and operational semantics.
